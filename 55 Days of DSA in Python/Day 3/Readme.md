### **[Day 4](./Day%204):**

#### **Backtracking**

Backtracking is a problem-solving technique where we incrementally build solutions and backtrack whenever a solution violates a constraint or is incomplete. It's widely used in problems like permutations, Sudoku solvers, and N-Queens.

---

### **What is Backtracking?**

Backtracking is a systematic way of exploring all possible configurations of a problem by building solutions step-by-step and undoing choices when they lead to invalid paths. It's based on the concept of depth-first search (DFS).

### **How is Backtracking Different from Recursion?**

| **Feature**              | **Recursion**                                                                 | **Backtracking**                                                                                           |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**            | A function calling itself until a base condition is met.                     | A recursive approach combined with a strategy to revert changes and explore other possibilities.          |
| **Focus**                 | Solving a problem by breaking it into smaller subproblems.                   | Exploring all possible solutions and rejecting invalid ones dynamically.                                  |
| **State Management**      | Does not necessarily revert changes made in recursive calls.                 | Explicitly undoes changes (backtracks) after a path is explored to restore the previous state.            |
| **Applications**          | Solving problems like Fibonacci sequence, factorial, etc.                   | Problems like permutations, combinations, Sudoku solver, N-Queens, and constraint satisfaction problems. |

### **How Does Backtracking Work?**

Backtracking involves:
1. **Choose**: Select a choice from available options.
2. **Explore**: Proceed with the choice recursively.
3. **Backtrack**: Undo the choice and try other options if the current path doesn't lead to a solution.

**Example**:  
For a problem to generate permutations of `[1, 2, 3]`:
- Start with `1` → Explore all permutations starting with `1`.
- Add `2` to `1` → Explore permutations of `[1, 2]`.
- Add `3` to `[1, 2]` → `[1, 2, 3]` is a valid permutation.
- Backtrack by removing `3` → Try other options for the third position.

### **Pass by Reference / Change Inplace**

Backtracking often involves modifying the state of a list or array directly (inplace).  
- **Pass by Reference**: The same object is modified across recursive calls.  
- **Undo Changes**: After exploring one path, the state is reverted to allow exploration of other paths.  

Example of inplace modification:
```python
nums[i], nums[j] = nums[j], nums[i]  # Swap to explore
# Perform recursive exploration
nums[i], nums[j] = nums[j], nums[i]  # Undo swap (backtrack)
```

---

### **Blueprint to Solve Questions Using Backtracking**

1. **Understand the Problem**:
   - Identify the constraints and the goal (e.g., generate permutations, solve Sudoku).

2. **Define the State**:
   - Decide how to represent the current state (e.g., a partial solution).

3. **Identify Choices**:
   - Enumerate the possible options at each step.

4. **Write the Recursive Function**:
   - Implement base and recursive cases.
   - Use a loop to iterate through possible choices.

5. **Backtrack**:
   - Revert the state after exploring a path to try other options.

---

### **Identify When to Use Backtracking**

Backtracking is suitable for problems with:
1. **Exhaustive Search**: Generating all configurations (e.g., permutations, combinations).  
2. **Constraints**: Solutions must satisfy specific conditions (e.g., N-Queens, Sudoku).  
3. **Optimization**: Searching for the best configuration under constraints.

### **Problem: Permutations**

The problem of generating all permutations of a given list of integers asks us to find every possible arrangement of the elements in the list, ensuring that each permutation is unique. A permutation is simply an ordered arrangement of elements.

**Key Points:**
- If the input list has `n` distinct elements, the total number of permutations is `n!` (n factorial), which means `n × (n-1) × (n-2) × ... × 1` possible arrangements.
- **Backtracking** is an ideal approach for generating permutations because we can incrementally build each permutation by swapping elements in place and then backtrack (undo the swap) to explore other potential arrangements.

**Code:**
```python
from typing import List

def permute(nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """
    Generate all permutations of a list of numbers using backtracking.

    Args:
        nums (List[int]): A list of integers to permute.

    Returns:
        List[List[int]]: A list containing all permutations of the input list.
    """
    res = []  # List to store all permutations
    n = len(nums)  # Length of the input list

    def backtrack(start: int):
        """
        Backtracking function to generate permutations.

        Args:
            start (int): Current index for permutation generation.
        """
        # Base Case: If we've reached the last index, add the permutation
        if start == n:
            res.append(nums[:])  # Append a copy of nums to results
            return

        # Iterate through the possible choices
        for i in range(start, n):
            # Swap the current index with the choice index
            nums[start], nums[i] = nums[i], nums[start]
            backtrack(start + 1)  # Recurse to the next index
            nums[start], nums[i] = nums[i], nums[start]  # Backtrack (undo the swap)

    backtrack(0)  # Start the recursion from the first index
    return res
```

**Explanation:**
1. We start by defining a function `permute` that takes a list `nums` as input.
2. The `backtrack` function is the core of the algorithm. It takes an index `start` as an argument, which keeps track of the current position in the list. Initially, `start` is `0`.
3. The base case for recursion is when `start == n`, meaning we have explored all positions and found a valid permutation.
4. At each step, we swap the current element with every subsequent element to generate a new permutation. After recursively exploring that permutation, we backtrack by swapping the elements back to restore the previous state.
5. This process generates all possible permutations of the list.

---

### **Problem: Unique Permutations**

In the case where the list might contain duplicate elements, we need to generate **unique permutations** only, meaning no duplicate arrangements. For example, given the list `[1, 1, 2]`, the possible permutations should be `[[1, 1, 2], [1, 2, 1], [2, 1, 1]]` and not `[1, 1, 2]` twice.

**Key Points:**
- To handle duplicates, we need to make sure that we don’t generate the same permutation more than once. This can be achieved by skipping elements that have already been used in the current recursion level.
- **Sorting the input** list initially helps because duplicate numbers will be adjacent to each other, making it easier to skip them.

**Code:**
```python
from typing import List

def permute_unique(nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """
    Generate all unique permutations of a list of numbers using backtracking.

    Args:
        nums (List[int]): A list of integers that might contain duplicates.

    Returns:
        List[List[int]]: A list containing all unique permutations of the input list.
    """
    res = []  # List to store all unique permutations

    def backtrack(start: int):
        """
        Backtracking function to generate unique permutations.

        Args:
            start (int): Current index for permutation generation.
        """
        if start == len(nums):
            res.append(nums[:])  # Append a copy of nums to results
            return

        seen = set()  # Set to track processed elements at the current recursion level
        for i in range(start, len(nums)):
            if nums[i] not in seen:  # Skip duplicate elements
                seen.add(nums[i])
                nums[start], nums[i] = nums[i], nums[start]  # Swap elements
                backtrack(start + 1)  # Recurse for the next index
                nums[start], nums[i] = nums[i], nums[start]  # Backtrack

    nums.sort()  # Sort the input to group duplicates
    backtrack(0)  # Start the recursion from the first index
    return res
```

**Explanation:**
1. We start by sorting the input list to bring duplicate elements together. This allows us to efficiently skip duplicates later.
2. The `backtrack` function is similar to the one in the standard permutation problem, but here we maintain a set called `seen` to track which elements have been processed at the current recursion level.
3. At each step, before making a recursive call, we check if the current element has been seen before. If it has, we skip it to avoid generating duplicate permutations.
4. The result is a list of all unique permutations of the input list.

### **Why Sorting is Important?**
Sorting the list at the beginning ensures that duplicate elements are adjacent to each other, making it easy to detect and skip duplicates when generating permutations. Without sorting, it would be difficult to efficiently identify duplicate elements, and the algorithm would generate duplicate permutations.
