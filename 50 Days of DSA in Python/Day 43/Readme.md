# **Day 43: Binary Trees - Level Order Traversal & Left/Right View**

Welcome to Day 43 of **50 Days of DSA in Python**! Today, we will explore **Level Order Traversal** and how to determine the **Left View** and **Right View** of a binary tree.

---

### **Topics Covered:**
- Level Order Traversal (Breadth-First Search)
- Left View of Binary Tree
- Right View of Binary Tree

## **1. Level Order Traversal (Breadth-First Search)**

### **Problem Statement**  
Given a binary tree, print its **level order traversal**. In level order traversal, we visit the nodes level by level from top to bottom, left to right. This can be efficiently done using a **queue**.

### **Approach**

1. Start by initializing a **queue** with the root node.
2. Traverse the tree level by level. For each level:
   - Dequeue the nodes one by one.
   - Enqueue the left and right children (if they exist).
   - Print the nodes at the current level.

#### **Code:**
```python
from collections import deque

class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, value=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.value = value
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def level_order_traversal(root):
    """
    Perform level order traversal (Breadth-First Search) of a binary tree.
    """
    if not root:
        return []
    
    result = []
    queue = deque([root])
    
    while queue:
        level = []
        level_length = len(queue)
        
        for _ in range(level_length):
            node = queue.popleft()
            level.append(node.value)
            
            if node.left:
                queue.append(node.left)
            if node.right:
                queue.append(node.right)
        
        result.append(level)
    
    return result

# Example:
root = TreeNode(1)
root.left = TreeNode(2)
root.right = TreeNode(3)
root.left.left = TreeNode(4)
root.left.right = TreeNode(5)

print("Level Order Traversal:", level_order_traversal(root))
```

### **Explanation:**
- We use a **queue** to traverse the tree level by level.
- Each iteration of the while loop processes one level, appending the node values at that level to the `result`.

## **2. Left View of Binary Tree**

### **Problem Statement**  
The **left view** of a binary tree is the set of nodes visible when the tree is viewed from the left side. The left view includes the first node at each level of the tree.

### **Approach**

1. Perform a **level order traversal**.
2. For each level, pick the first node. This node will be part of the left view.
3. The first node at each level is the leftmost node of that level.

#### **Code:**
```python
def left_view(root):
    """
    Return the left view of a binary tree.
    """
    if not root:
        return []
    
    result = []
    queue = deque([root])
    
    while queue:
        level_length = len(queue)
        
        for i in range(level_length):
            node = queue.popleft()
            
            # If it is the first node of the level, add it to the result
            if i == 0:
                result.append(node.value)
            
            if node.left:
                queue.append(node.left)
            if node.right:
                queue.append(node.right)
    
    return result

# Example:
print("Left View:", left_view(root))
```

### **Explanation:**
- The left view is generated by capturing the first node of each level during a **level order traversal**.
- By checking `if i == 0`, we ensure that only the first node in each level is added to the result.

## **3. Right View of Binary Tree**

### **Problem Statement**  
The **right view** of a binary tree is the set of nodes visible when the tree is viewed from the right side. The right view includes the last node at each level of the tree.

### **Approach**

1. Perform a **level order traversal**.
2. For each level, pick the last node. This node will be part of the right view.
3. The last node at each level is the rightmost node of that level.

#### **Code:**
```python
def right_view(root):
    """
    Return the right view of a binary tree.
    """
    if not root:
        return []
    
    result = []
    queue = deque([root])
    
    while queue:
        level_length = len(queue)
        
        for i in range(level_length):
            node = queue.popleft()
            
            # If it is the last node of the level, add it to the result
            if i == level_length - 1:
                result.append(node.value)
            
            if node.left:
                queue.append(node.left)
            if node.right:
                queue.append(node.right)
    
    return result

# Example:
print("Right View:", right_view(root))
```

### **Explanation:**
- The right view is generated by capturing the last node of each level during a **level order traversal**.
- By checking `if i == level_length - 1`, we ensure that only the last node in each level is added to the result.

### **Conclusion**

In todayâ€™s session, we:
- Explored **Level Order Traversal** (Breadth-First Search) to traverse the binary tree level by level.
- Implemented the **Left View** and **Right View** of a binary tree by performing **level order traversal** and capturing the first and last node at each level respectively.

Key takeaways:
- **Level Order Traversal** can be implemented using a **queue**, ensuring nodes are processed level by level.
- **Left View** captures the first node at each level, while the **Right View** captures the last node at each level.
